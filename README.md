# zsh-theme
A simple script to setup an awesome shell environment with:
* powerlevel10k theme (https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
* zsh-completions (https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions)
* zsh-autosuggestions (https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
* zsh-syntax-highlighting (https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
* history-substring-search (https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search)
* k (https://github.com/supercrabtree/k)

Sets following useful aliases:
* l="ls -lah"         - just type "l" instead of "ls -lah"
* alias k="k -h"	  - show human readable filesizes, in kb, mb etc
* x="exit"

## Installation

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/gustavohellwig/zsh-theme.git ~/.zsh-theme
cd .zsh-theme
./zsh-theme.sh
```

Change your terminals fonts to either "RobotoMono Nerd Font" or "Hack Nerd Font" or "DejaVu Sans Mono Nerd Fonts".
You can also manually install Nerd Fonts of your choice.

## Notes
* If you are already using zsh, your zsh config will be backed up to .zshrc-backup-date
* If the text/icons look broken, make sure your terminal is using one of the Nerd fonts. I recommend "RobotoMono Nerd Font"
